## GANdy Warhol: creating abstract art using deep learning
A project for Le Wagon Batch #805 by Eloho Kemi, Flavien Kuss-Vargas, Saul Wegzryn, and YiWen Hon

We created a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DC GAN) and trained it on 3600 images of Abstract Expressionist art. We also created an Autoencoder and K-Nearest Neighbours model to evaluate the output of our deep learning model.

The live project is showcased at https://share.streamlit.io/FlavKV/website/website.py

Huge thank you to Yassine, Yannis, Cristophe, Julio, Marie, and all the other Le Wagon staff for being so patient and generous with their time and knowledge.
